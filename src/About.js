            <div className = "exhibit-center-container"><p>My role as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the Lab of Language, Cognition and Computation has empowered me to contribute meaningfully to the field of data science both within and beyond the laboratory. Inside the lab, I co-organize educational workshops on campus, collaborate on projects with PhD peers on research initiatives, and mentor volunteer lab assistants as they begin their journey into scientific inquiry. These experiences allow me to foster a culture of curiosity, collaboration, and growth.</p></div>
            <div className = "exhibit-center-container"><p>Outside the lab, I dedicate my time to mentoring through the UIC Women in Computer Science Aspire to Inspire Program, guiding mentees through their academic paths. Mentorship is deeply personal to me, without the guidance I received early on into my own path, I may never have discovered the transformative power of technology to shape society. Now, I pay it forward by mentoring others to find their purpose in their work.</p></div>
